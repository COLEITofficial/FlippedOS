 **HOW TO USE** 
 
 After downloading the .txt, simply place it in your BadUSB folder on your flipper zero. I like to use payloads with BadBT, as it's much more practical to use and easier to trick people with.
 
 Connect your flipper to the targets device, then run the payload. If it doesn't hit the first time, spam it a couple times until it works. (just how IOS payloads are cause they weird kinda)
